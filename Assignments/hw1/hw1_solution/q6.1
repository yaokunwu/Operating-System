Assume turn is initialized to 1.

A possible sequence that violate  mutual exclusion is given below:

P0: blocked[0]:=true;
P0: while (turn != 0) -> true
P0: while (blocked[1]) -> false
P1: blocked[1]:=true;
P1: while (turn != 1) -> false
P1: <critical section>  //P(1) goes into CS
P0: turn:=0;
P0: while (turn != 0) -> false
P0: <critical section>  //P(0) goes into CS
